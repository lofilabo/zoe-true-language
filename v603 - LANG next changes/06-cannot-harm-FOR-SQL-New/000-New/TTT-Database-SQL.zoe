Does this not work?
Do you care about database access?
If NOT, comment or delete it (or separate into its own file!).


If you DO cate, make sure this:

	1. SQLite is installed.

		sudo apt install sqlite3
		sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev

	2. Test basics:

		./zdb_check

}^.^


oh look ! 

^.^{
can you see a message of results on screen?
This is from zdb_basement.
Our pencil is not recieving anything :(
This is why the 'returned message' is written to zdb_output_data.txt
}^.^

	CAN HAS MYLIB?
	^.^ 
	^.^ pencil "this is from background.  Please check >> zdb_output_data.txt  << for the actual results"
	^.^ pencil "in future...  please looks at execvp  ( ./zdb_basement  ,argv1  ) in unacceptable.c, look up '//fork()'"
	pencil ""
	pencil "Results:"

	^.^ Select some of these tests!
	pencil I wish_to_call MYLIB --toBaby--> zoeSQL <--[ "SELECT * from testtable" ]--<
	pencil I wish_to_call MYLIB --toBaby--> zoeSQL <--[ "SELECT * from testtable where id=1" ]--<
	pencil I wish_to_call MYLIB --toBaby--> zoeSQL <--[ "SELECT * from testtable where id=1 or id=2" ]--<
	pencil I wish_to_call MYLIB --toBaby--> zoeSQL <--[ "SELECT * from testtable where id<>1" ]--<

	^.^ this pencile prints the Reurn vales from the C part
